Explain the meaning of Abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex ideas by removing non-essential details, 
focusing only on the crucial aspects. In programming, it involves creating and using 
simplified representations of complex systems, making it easier for developers to 
interact with and understand those systems without needing to know every intricate detail.

Highlight a benefit of Abstraction:
A key benefit of abstraction is that it enables a higher level of comprehension and 
efficiency in software development. Developers can work with higher-level concepts 
without being bogged down by the underlying complexities. This enhances code readability, 
maintenance, and collaboration, ultimately leading to more effective and scalable software development.

Provide an application of Abstraction:
One practical application of abstraction in programming is the use of functions or 
methods. For instance, the Python `print` function serves as an abstraction. Instead of 
understanding the intricate details of how text is displayed on a computer, programmers can 
simply use the `print` function, which internally handles the complexity. This allows developers 
to focus on the high-level task of displaying text without dealing with the low-level 
implementation details.

Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote:

The code snippet:
using System;
public class Job
{
    // Public fields
    public string _company;
    public string _jobTitle;
    public int _startYear;
    public int _endYear;
    
    // Method to display job information
    public void DisplayJobInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{_jobTitle} ({_company}) {_startYear}-{_endYear}");
    }
}
the 'Job' class abstracts the concept of a job by encapsulating its properties and behavior, thereby 
providing a higher-level representation that simplifies the usage of job-related information in a 
program. This abstraction enhances code readability and ease of use.

Thoroughly explain these concepts:
Abstraction simplifies complex ideas, allowing programmers to work with higher-level concepts e.g. 
the "print" fuction, by simplifying such a complex code into a simple word "print", we do not need 
to understand the underlying code implementation details. Its benefits include improved code 
readability, maintenance, and collaboration. The provided snippet,  exemplifies code ease of use.
